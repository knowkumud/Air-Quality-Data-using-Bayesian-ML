**Question:**
Prepare your own image dataset for binary classification with two classes: Fox v/s Dog. Use an appropriate neural network library (JAX or any other library) and a small CNN (not necessary to use big models like ResNet, or VGG if you do not have the compute power). Use an appropriate active learning algorithm from https://modal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ library and show the active learning iterations v/s test accuracy curve. Explain your insights.

**Resources:**
https://www.machinelearningnuggets.com/image-classification-with-jax-flax/ After training the initial model, you can use an active learning algorithm from the MODAL Python library to select the most informative samples from the unlabeled dataset for annotation. The active learning algorithm will iteratively select the samples that are most likely to improve the performance of your model.

 I retrain the model and evaluate its performance on the test set.
The image data set is takem from Google images, Stanford Dogs Dataset, Imagenet

**Insights:**
Active learning can be an effective technique for reducing the labeling effort required to train a good classification model. By iteratively selecting the most informative samples, active learning can reduce the number of samples needed to be labeled while maintaining or even improving the accuracy of the model.
The performance of the active learning algorithm depends on the quality of the initial model and the selection strategy used to identify the most informative samples. Therefore, it is important to choose a good initial model and a suitable selection strategy for your task.
The active learning algorithm can reach a plateau after a certain number of iterations, indicating that further annotation may not significantly improve the performance of the model. In this case, it may be more beneficial to focus on improving the quality of the annotated samples rather than annotating more samples.
