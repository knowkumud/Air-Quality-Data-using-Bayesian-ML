The first section of the script defines the parameters for the two Gaussian distributions, including their means (mu1 and mu2), standard deviations (sigma1 and sigma2), and weights (weight1 and weight2). The weights represent the proportion of samples that come from each Gaussian component, with weight1 and weight2 summing to 1. In this case, the first Gaussian has a mean of 2, a standard deviation of 0.5, and a weight of 0.6, while the second Gaussian has a mean of 5, a standard deviation of 1, and a weight of 0.4.

A random sample from the mixture of the two Gaussians which takes the mean, standard deviation, and size of the sample as input arguments, and generates random numbers from a Gaussian distribution with the specified mean and standard deviation. The size of the sample is determined by multiplying the total number of samples by the weight of each Gaussian component and then rounding down to the nearest integer.

The two samples generated from the two Gaussian distributions into a single array, samples. The script then plots the histogram of the samples using the matplotlib.pyplot.hist() function, which takes the samples as input, along with the number of bins, the density argument set to True to normalize the histogram, and the alpha argument set to 0.6 to adjust the opacity of the histogram.

The result is plotted on the same graph as the histogram.
